        . On one level, this is a corporate branding choice. On another, it acts
        as a symbolic start button, inviting the audience into a curated portal
        of music, movement, and political commentary. Pressing ‚Äústart‚Äù signals
        the beginning of a hypermodal experience where visuals, sound, and
        symbolism work together to deliver layered meaning.

        , is deeply meaningful. Known for its rich Black cultural history, jazz
        traditions, and post-Katrina political struggles, the city frames the
        performance in a context of resilience, resistance, and celebration. The
        Superdome itself embodies this duality: a site of historic entertainment
        and of social challenges. By opening the performance here, Kendrick
        anchors his show in a specific political and cultural landscape.

      <Typography paragraph>
        The opening track isn‚Äôt by Kendrick himself, but by Ghais Guevara, who
        is a hip-hop artist, political activist, and cultural commentator. The
        choice of this song sets both a political and spiritual tone for what
        follows. It signals to the audience that the performance is not just
        about halftime entertainment, but a deeper statement about social and
        cultural identity. By foregrounding Ghais‚Äôs voice, Kendrick anchors the
        show within a tradition of resistance, making it clear that the stage is
        also a platform for protest.
